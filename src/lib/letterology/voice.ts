/**
 * Voice law — every public line obeys this.
 *
 * 1. Name the move first. We looked at the letters of this username.
 * 2. Say what it means in ordinary life. So this name starts as a Seeker.
 * 3. Then the metaphor may decorate. Never instead of 1 and 2.
 * 4. Because / so / that means. If a tired person cannot repeat the rule, rewrite.
 * 5. One idea per sentence.
 * 6. Proper nouns stay (CC33, Letter Path, Seeker, The Count, Stoicheia). Translate next.
 * 7. No house-verb in UI. Ban list is FORBIDDEN_UI.
 * 8. Buttons are verbs a guest already knows.
 * 9. Share lines stay short.
 * 10. Portraits get one caption. Essays live in sheets and Why.
