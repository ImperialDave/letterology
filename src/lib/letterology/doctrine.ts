      "A system that reads a birth name as fate has already decided the person is property of a record office. We do not do that. A system that folds twenty-six letters into nine digits has already decided that difference is an inconvenience. We do not do that. Luck is not fate. Luck is willingness: which letters run warm today, and which withdraw.",
      "Numerology asks a name to become a number so a life can be held in one hand. Astrology asks a birth hour to become a weather report. Both are serious in their own houses. This house is different. We ask only: what letters did you put into the world, and what work do those letters already know how to do?",

      "A legal name is an inheritance. It was spoken over you before you could refuse it. A username is a vow. You chose it in public, or you accepted the one the room gave you and then lived inside it long enough that it became a second skin. Either way, it is the name that does work.",
      "That is why the door does not ask for your legal name. It asks for the username you use. @ is optional because the at-sign is furniture. Only A through Z are read, because those are the twenty-six roles. Accents fold so a mark from another tongue can still name a role without being punished for its origin.",
      "If you sit the house with X, the screen name arrives as the handle and is not offered back for editing. Destiny you already posted under is not a preference. If you come by Google, you claim. Claiming is not branding. It is taking responsibility for a spelling.",

      "We could have let the most common letter sit the house. That would have made the role a popularity contest. We could have let the last letter sit it. That would have made the role an ending. A role is how you enter. So the first letter enters.",

    paragraphs: [
      "Once the house is sat, the question is not who you are. The question is how the work is done, and in what kind of place. Those are the second and third seats of the Letter Path: manner and field.",
      "Order after the first letter is an accident of spelling. Weight is not. A letter that returns, a letter that opens a word, a letter that closes one — these are decisions the handle keeps making. The engine counts them. Repeats count more because insistence is information. First and last letters of a token count extra because edges are where a name touches the air.",
      "The two letters that weigh most after the signature become manner and field. Three letters, one path. The path has a title because a nameless triad is a code, and a code is how you hide from the person you are reading. We name it so it can be spoken.",

    title: "Why the alphabet is the wheel",
    paragraphs: [
      "Twelve is a sky count. It is months, signs, hours doubled. It is a good count for bodies that orbit. It is a poor count for speech. Speech already divided itself into twenty-six public marks. Everyone who can read this page already carries the set. We did not invent a zodiac and then rent it letters. We took the set that was already the commons.",
      "Each letter sits a house with an old face — Seeker, Caregiver, Rebel, Hermit, Fool — because those figures were already doing the work of describing roles before we arrived. Pearson, Campbell, the tarot: these are correspondences, not creeds. A likeness. The house doctrine is written in plain English so it can be refused. A system you cannot refuse is a church.",
      "A sits amber at dawn and the wheel walks the spectrum to ochre at Z. Color is not garnish. It is the house made visible at the size of a seal. Three seats pour one mix: the house half the pot, manner three-tenths, field two-tenths. The role leads. How you work colors it. Where you work tints it. That is the Letter Path as a single fact you can see.",

    paragraphs: [
      "A role that has no one to finish its work is a pose. A role that has no one to contradict it is a lie. Each house therefore keeps a court: three allies, three enemies. The allies are not friends. They are the figures that complete the job. The enemies are not villains. They are the blind spot — the house that will not let this one sleep.",
      "The circle is a graph, not a mood board. Distance is walked. An official ally sits one hop. An unrelated house may sit two hops or five. We used to pretend those distances were the same — four buckets, and everything that was not kin was simply “none.” That was a laziness. The live reading uses the actual walks: hops, resonance, the cost of carrying one name’s letters across to another. Unrelated is not a single country.",
      "If a handle already carries an allied letter, that help is in the name. If it does not, the help comes from outside — which is to say, from other people. That is not a defect. It is a map of who you will have to ask.",

      "A vowel is a sound you can hold with the mouth open. A consonant is a sound that requires a collision. The inner life is held. The outer life collides. So vowels describe the private weather, consonants the public work.",
      "Y is the exception that proves the rule: a vowel only after it has already begun, never as the first step. The signature Y would be a start. We do not let it pretend to be breath until it has already entered as a mark.",

    title: "Why a day uses the same wheel",
    paragraphs: [
      "If time used another alphabet we would have two religions in one house. So a day is read as a name is read. The date names the role — the thirteenth is M, as a username beginning with M is M. The two-week stretch sets how the season works: fourteen days, one letter, A to Z from the twenty-first of March. The weekday is what today is about, drawn from that stretch’s own helpers and pushbacks: the role, then its three allies, then its three enemies.",
      "The civil year and the month have roles too. They are background. They color the air. They do not get to rename Tuesday. A system that lets the year rename the day has already decided that the large always owns the small. We do not grant that.",
      "The leftover day or two before the next twenty-first of March have no numbered role. They belong to the Fool. The year has finished the circle and has not begun again. Travel light. That leftover is the same Fool as the blank when a count has nothing to write.",

    title: "A bond is a fit of materials, not a verdict",
    paragraphs: [
      "Two usernames are two piles of letters. We do not ask if they are soulmates. We ask how the piles meet: role, method, place, overlap of spelling, gifts (an ally one is missing that the other already carries), temper, court, spark. Eight measures, because one number is how you hide an argument.",
      "The affinity is a fit. It is not a forecast. A high fit can be a trap. A hard weather can be a life’s work. The certificate names the pair because an unnamed comparison is a scoreboard, and a scoreboard is numerology in a nicer font.",

    title: "We write amounts as letters",
    paragraphs: [
      "A number arrives claiming neutrality. It is not neutral. It is a compression: of rank, of year, of money, of a phone that can reach a body. Numerology accepted that compression and then compressed further, folding the leftover into a single digit so the hand could close.",
      "We refuse the fold. An amount is written as letters or it is not read. A is one. Z is twenty-six. AA is twenty-seven. The whole amount also has a role — the same letter a date or a year already uses — so a year and that year’s amount cannot disagree. If the amount walked the twenty-six more than once, those walks are letters too. Nested, not reduced.",
      "Zero is the Fool as absence: you write nothing. Six is the Fool as the sixth role, only when an old digit arrives. Same figure, two doors. There is no 0th of the month, so zero cannot name a date-role; it is the blank, which the calendar already knew. J is not 1. J is the tenth role. To wrap J back to A is to say the walk never happened.",

      "Each day the date names a house, the way the thirteenth is M. That house keeps a court: three allies, three enemies. Allies run warm — favorable currents. Enemies withdraw — contrary currents. The letters do not change their nature. Only their willingness.",
      "Your luck today is the meeting of your Path with that court. If your house is in the warm seats, doors ajar. If your manner withdraws, do not force the method you usually trust. If the day's letter is already in your handle, the day is using something you already carry — home-field, not destiny.",
      "A decision is also a name. Letterize the act. Ask two questions only: is this my kind of move, and is this house willing today? That is how you predict your own luck — not by asking a priest, but by reading the materials you already put into the world against the court the calendar already named.",
