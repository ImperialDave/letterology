 * The 24 as a book, not a list.
 * Sound from the mouth (Cratylus + the old grammar). Element from Empedocles via phonetics.
 * Bare / middle / aspirate is the mute series (ψιλά / μέσα / δασέα).
 * Semivowel is Dionysius Thrax’s ἡμίφωνα — liquids, the edge, the doubles.
 * Milesian weight is the same mark used as a number. ϛ ϟ ϡ never sit a name.
